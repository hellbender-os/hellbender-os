/*
The characteristics of floating types are defined in terms of a model that describes a representation of floating-point numbers and values that provide information about an implementation's floating-point arithmetic.

The following parameters are used to define the model for each floating-point type:

s
Sign (Â±1).
b
Base or radix of exponent representation (an integer >1).
e
Exponent (an integer between a minimum emin and a maximum emax).
p
Precision (the number of base-b digits in the significand).
fk
Non-negative integers less than b (the significand digits).
A floating-point number x is defined by the following model:



In addition to normalized floating-point numbers (f1>0 if x!=0), floating types may be able to contain other kinds of floating-point numbers, such as subnormal floating-point numbers (x!=0, e= emin, f1=0) and unnormalized floating-point numbers (x!=0, e> emin, f1=0), and values that are not floating-point numbers, such as infinities and NaNs. A NaN is an encoding signifying Not-a-Number. A quiet NaN propagates through almost every arithmetic operation without raising a floating-point exception; a signaling NaN generally raises a floating-point exception when occurring as an arithmetic operand.

An implementation may give zero and non-numeric values, such as infinities and NaNs, a sign, or may leave them unsigned. Wherever such values are unsigned, any requirement in POSIX.1-2008 to retrieve the sign shall produce an unspecified sign and any requirement to set the sign shall be ignored.

The accuracy of the floating-point operations ( '+', '-', '*', '/' ) and of the functions in <math.h> and <complex.h> that return floating-point results is implementation-defined, as is the accuracy of the conversion between floating-point internal representations and string representations performed by the functions in <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, and <wchar.h>. The implementation may state that the accuracy is unknown.

All integer values in the <float.h> header, except FLT_ROUNDS, shall be constant expressions suitable for use in #if preprocessing directives; all floating values shall be constant expressions. All except DECIMAL_DIG, FLT_EVAL_METHOD, FLT_RADIX, and FLT_ROUNDS have separate names for all three floating-point types. The floating-point model representation is provided for all values except FLT_EVAL_METHOD and FLT_ROUNDS.

The rounding mode for floating-point addition is characterized by the implementation-defined value of FLT_ROUNDS:

-1
Indeterminable.
 0
Toward zero.
 1
To nearest.
 2
Toward positive infinity.
 3
Toward negative infinity.
All other values for FLT_ROUNDS characterize implementation-defined rounding behavior.

The values of operations with floating operands and values subject to the usual arithmetic conversions and of floating constants are evaluated to a format whose range and precision may be greater than required by the type. The use of evaluation formats is characterized by the implementation-defined value of FLT_EVAL_METHOD:

-1
Indeterminable.
 0
Evaluate all operations and constants just to the range and precision of the type.
 1
Evaluate operations and constants of type float and double to the range and precision of the double type; evaluate long double operations and constants to the range and precision of the long double type.
 2
Evaluate all operations and constants to the range and precision of the long double type.
All other negative values for FLT_EVAL_METHOD characterize implementation-defined behavior.

The <float.h> header shall define the following values as constant expressions with implementation-defined values that are greater or equal in magnitude (absolute value) to those shown, with the same sign.

Radix of exponent representation, b.

FLT_RADIX
2
Number of base-FLT_RADIX digits in the floating-point significand, p.

FLT_MANT_DIG

DBL_MIN_10_EXP

LDBL_MIN_10_EXP
