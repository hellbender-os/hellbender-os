/*
The <unistd.h> header defines miscellaneous symbolic constants and types, and declares miscellaneous functions. The actual values of the constants are unspecified except as shown. The contents of this header are shown below.

Version Test Macros

The <unistd.h> header shall define the following symbolic constants. The values shall be suitable for use in #if preprocessing directives.

_POSIX_VERSION
Integer value indicating version of this standard (C-language binding) to which the implementation conforms. For implementations conforming to POSIX.1-2008, the value shall be 200809L.
_POSIX2_VERSION
Integer value indicating version of the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1 to which the implementation conforms. For implementations conforming to POSIX.1-2008, the value shall be 200809L. For profile implementations that define _POSIX_SUBPROFILE (see Subprofiling Considerations) in <unistd.h>, POSIX2_VERSION may be left undefined or be defined with the value -1 to indicate that the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1 is not supported. In this case, a call to sysconf(_SC_2_VERSION) shall return either 200809L or -1 indicating that the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1 is or is not, respectively, supported at runtime.
The <unistd.h> header shall define the following symbolic constant only if the implementation supports the XSI option; see XSI Conformance. If defined, its value shall be suitable for use in #if preprocessing directives.

_XOPEN_VERSION
[XSI] [Option Start]
Integer value indicating version of the X/Open Portability Guide to which the implementation conforms. The value shall be 700. [Option End]
Constants for Options and Option Groups

The following symbolic constants, if defined in <unistd.h>, shall have a value of -1, 0, or greater, unless otherwise specified below. For profile implementations that define _POSIX_SUBPROFILE (see Subprofiling Considerations) in <unistd.h>, constants described below as always having a value greater than zero need not be defined and, if defined, may have a value of -1, 0, or greater. The values shall be suitable for use in #if preprocessing directives.

If a symbolic constant is not defined or is defined with the value -1, the option is not supported for compilation. If it is defined with a value greater than zero, the option shall always be supported when the application is executed. If it is defined with the value zero, the option shall be supported for compilation and might or might not be supported at runtime. See Options for further information about the conformance requirements of these three categories of support.

The format of each name shall be suitable for use with the getconf -v option.
_CS_V7_ENV
This is the value that provides the environment variable information (other than that provided by _CS_PATH) that is required by the implementation to create a conforming environment, as described in the implementation's conformance documentation.
