/* Low memory (<= HIGH_MEMORY_LIMIT) is assumed to be identity mapped
 * by boot_32 code. Thus it is safe to initialize the low memory
 * manager in the beginning of boot_64.
 * Low memory is used by kernel heap.
 * Low memory is also good for PCI DMA stuff.
 *
 * Low memory is split into page tables (2MB worth of memory).
 * Each table can be either free, allocated, or split.
 * Free table means that no memory within the table is in use.
 * Allocated table means that the whole 2MB table is in use.
 * Split table means that only some of the 4k pages in the table
 * have been allocated.
 * 
 * Memory can be allocated either 2MB table at a time,
 * 4k page at a time, or some multiple of 4k pages at a time.
 * 4k allocations are preferred, since anything more will
 * require a free table, even when allocating less than 2MB.
